      <h2>About Aranta:</h2>

      <article class="main-about">
        The city of Aranta in the north was founded by the Elves, Ashkalots, and Humans over two thousand years ago.<br>The Elves were the first to arrive in the area, drawn by its natural beauty and seclusion.<br>They quickly established a village on the banks of the nearby river, where they could easily fish and hunt for food.
<br>The Ashkalots arrived shortly after the Elves, having heard stories of the lush forests and abundant wildlife in the region.<br>They set up their own village a short distance away from the Elves, but still close enough to share resources and knowledge.
<br>The Humans arrived some time later, though they had been exploring the area for many years prior.<br>Initially, they kept to themselves, but eventually they began trading with both the Elves and Ashkalots.<br>This led to an influx of people from all three races settling in the area, creating a diverse and vibrant community.
<br>In time, this small settlement grew into what is now known as Aranta: a bustling city filled with artisans and merchants from all walks of life.<br>The city has seen its fair share of hardships throughout its history, but it has always persevered and continues to thrive today.
